                    <b>🔹 My Journey 🔹</b>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    As an international graduate, adaptability is at the core of my journey. Stepping out of my comfort zone and embracing a new country, culture, and educational system has been a transformative experience. My ability to adapt quickly to diverse environments and circumstances sets me apart. In the professional realm, my adaptability shines as I readily integrate diverse ideas and viewpoints, fostering an inclusive and productive environment. I am a proactive team player, eager to take on new roles and responsibilities when needed.

                    <b>🔹 Collaborative Problem Solver 🔹</b>
                    <br />
                    <br />  
                    As a firm believer in continuous growth, I approach every challenge and opportunity as a chance to learn and improve. When confronted with complex challenges, I approach them with a combination of analytical thinking, creativity, and perseverance.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Moreover, I firmly believe that effective problem-solving is a collaborative effort. I actively seek input from team members, encouraging open communication. By leveraging the collective intelligence of the team, we can arrive at more robust and comprehensive solutions.
